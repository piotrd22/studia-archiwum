## Concurrent programming

A course on concurrent programming, we solved classic problems such as starvation, race condition and deadlock.

We learned more about the work on many threads/processes.

We learned about semaphores, IPC semaphores, lock files, shared memory, conditions, child processes, locking, FIFO queues, IPC message queues, UDP/TCP sockets, etc.
